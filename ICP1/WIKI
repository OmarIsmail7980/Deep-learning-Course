1) The answer for question will be in in file Question1. I listed three differences between Python 2 and python 3


2) Since qustion consisted of 2 parts I placed both parts in the same file.
      The first part was reverse the input string. the program takes the input, removes 2 characters then prints out the reversed string
      the second part took an integer inputs from the user the prints out all the arithmitcs operations using the inputs
      
3) the code is in the file Question3
   The program succesfully changes accurance of python with pythons using the method called replace() then prints out the sentence with the new changes
